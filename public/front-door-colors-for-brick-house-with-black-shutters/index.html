<p>Pink goes beautifully with many different types of flowers. “what’s nice about a black front door on a red brick home is it really pops, especially if you have white trim somewhere around the property whether it be the soffit, the fascia board, or the capping around the windows. Grey for a classic neutral look; The trim here is all wood. Comments (21) green will look great with your color of brick!</p>

<p>The blue and black color combination looks great with red brick exteriors. Or a very dark olive green, not the blue/green on your sample. The door is indeed wood, and it is custom stained. It stands out in its wood color. Comments (21) green will look great with your color of brick!</p>
