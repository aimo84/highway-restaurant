After researching this issue regarding a fishy smell in my house without having cooked fish, i found this post and comments regarding possibly electrical faulty light fittings etc. I initially thought it was a dead rat or something but when i noticed the smell would completely disappear in the morning i started to suspect it was something else.</p>

<p>About a week ago we noticed a fish smell at the bottom of the stairs and in one of the upstairs bedroom. Lopez recommends cooking the fish in a flavored liquid, such as court bouillon, which will help veil any fish odor.

<p>Think melted electrical outlets, sizzling overheated circuits, or faulty wiring.or it could also be something as simple as using the wrong wattage light bulb in a lamp. Sufferers report smelling hydrogen sulfide (rotten eggs), bad perfume, garbage, a gas leak, wet dog, pungent body odor or spoiled fish or feces. In one of the groups, a facebook user asked how to remove unpleasant fish smells from her home. Mildew loves moisture, which is why you’ll often find it in the bathroom. No smell during the day and arrives in the evening some days stronger than others.</p>
