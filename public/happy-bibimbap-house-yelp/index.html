<p>Also tried a bento box, pancakes, and glass noodles. The key aspect of this restaurant is chinese and korean cuisines. I have tried their chicken rice, bbq ribs, and their bbq pork. I am not a big fan or expert in korean food in general but everything here tasted quite bland, the seafood was too chewy (almost not edible). The menu is limited but the food is pretty good.</p>
