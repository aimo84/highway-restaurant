<p>House mice are almost the same size as field mice. Members of the superfamily muroidea that exceed a certain size are referred to as rats, while smaller species are referred to as mice. The coloring scheme, as well as the location (near homes), is a pretty good giveaway. There is usually some size variance, but they are basically like very small brown grains of cooking rice.
