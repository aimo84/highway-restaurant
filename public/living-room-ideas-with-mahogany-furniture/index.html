<p>White Curtains Brown Shades. Lastly number 1 an Old Car Sofa upcycling idea It probably will require a little help from a professional for this old car sofa. Choosing an all-white color scheme creates a very bright and clean-looking space which also tends to have a more futuristic living room feel to it especially when furnished with modern furniture piecesIn this example you will see that all surfaces walls floors ceiling and even the window treatments are all in white including all furniture pieces save for a few accessories and some indoor plants.
