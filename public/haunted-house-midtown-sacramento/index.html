<p>What i will tell you is about the history of midtown sacramento and what could possibly be haunting this home. The house was built some time in the late 1800s, and was used over the years as a jail, an inn and restaurant, and, as its name implies, a winery. The arena is over 5,000 square feet and will be quite a show with scare actors and haunted sets! The staff was very friendly and the food was made to order. The building is three stories, romanesque revival style, with moorish and byzantine elements from 1928.</p>
