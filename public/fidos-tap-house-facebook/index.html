<p>On their facebook and instagram, fido’s regularly posts about new foster dogs and successful adoption stories, as well as featuring their delicious food. While there are beers and snacks, fido’s dog house hopes to emphasize rescue and giving back to dog charities. Fido’s tap house is located in tigard, oregon (near portland) and the concept is simple: Combine 40 taps of craft beer, cider and wine with a bunch of good puppers and doggos from a nearby. What they're doing for local shelter dogs is very special.</p>
