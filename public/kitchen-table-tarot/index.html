Kitchen Table Tarot was written as a guide for anyone looking for no-nonsense lessons with a warm friendly and knowledgeable teacher. Without my prompting or hinting one client recently praised the book and said she loves how easy-to-read it is and how accessible the information is. The cover of the book is light and cute which may throw off some readers but it fits perfectly with the theme of the book as a whole.</p>
