<p>As it turns out, taking a shower just exacerbated the faulty electrical switch because the bathroom wiring was routed through that outlet. Does it seem to always present itself in one particular spot at random? When you have a fishy smell in your home that you can’t pinpoint, you might first think it is a plumbing or hvac issue. Why is there a fishy smell in my house? Electrical shielding, wires, and other plastic components emit a “fish” or “urine” smell when exposed to high heat.</p>

<p>Have you been noticing a fishy odor coming and going in the house? We see this particular issue time &amp; time again, this particular problem happened when a electric heater rated at around 13a are used for long periods the fuse is. The insulation around the light fixture or plastic components in outlets, switches and light fixtures overheating will throw off that odor. Generally, such a smell is caused by the arcing of electrical device. Do not place off an examination by a certified electrical contractor if you.</p>

<p>That fishy smell could be overheating or smoldering plastic in your light fixtures, power outlets, or wiring in your walls! And much to my dismay my fishy smell in house search turns up something perhaps scarier than a dead animal wasting away between my walls. You see, most wires, circuit breakers, etc. Generally, such a smell is caused by the arcing of electrical device. Nine times out of 10, a fishy smell throughout the home means you have overheating electrical components (circuit breakers, outlets, wiring, etc.).</p>

<p>Generally, such a smell is caused by the arcing of electrical device. When you have a fishy smell in your home that you can’t pinpoint, you might first think it is a plumbing or hvac issue. Usually, the fish smell is an early indicator of a serious electrical problem that could lead to a fire. Believe it or not, if you smell something fishy in your home, it could be electrical in nature. Besides burning the house down, why is it so dangerous to ignore the smell?</p>
