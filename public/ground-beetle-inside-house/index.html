<p>The most common species are known as weevils. Most of the beetles found in homes are carpet beetles, which are attracted to the keratin found in many fabrics. These beetles are always attracted to lightning. Ground beetles are commonly found underwood, rocks, or objects left on the ground. The wormlike larvae spend their time in soil or hidden and are usually not seen.</p>
