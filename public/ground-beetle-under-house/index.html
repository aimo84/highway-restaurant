<p>Most species of ground beetle are carnivorous, and some will run swiftly to catch their prey. Remove decaying wood and calk all crevices on the exterior of the house. They feed mostly at night, and may be attracted to lights. These insects are mainly outdoor pests and live in the damp, dark soil under woodpiles, piles of leaves, fallen trees, logs, and rocks. Light attracts ground beetles to homes.</p>

<p>However, if they are creating a nuisance, move or remove hiding places next to the house such as log piles, mulch, and debris around the perimeter. Ground beetles are a nuisance indoors. These insects also don't bite or sting humans. Since ground beetles are beneficial insects, control is not warranted. Caulking and weatherstripping will close some entrance points.</p>
