<p>While it’s not easy to spot if you have termites at home, flying termites are one of the clearest signs of a termite problem and they could mean trouble to you and your home! Winged termites are highly attracted to sources of light such as street lamps and can often be found swarming around these sources. If you have any of these signs, then you do have serious problems. Large numbers of winged termites strongly suggest a mature colony is nearby; Flying termites are one of the clearest signs of a termite problem, and they could mean trouble to you and your home!</p>

<p>Do flying termites come out at night? Instead, expect them to come in a swarm where you can find about hundreds or thousands of them. If you see them indoors, they’ve already likely established a colony within your home and are eating up your wood and furniture. That’s because flying termites are social creatures that prefer to work in groups, similar to ants and bees. Flying ants don’t represent any greater threat to humans than their wingless counterparts.</p>
