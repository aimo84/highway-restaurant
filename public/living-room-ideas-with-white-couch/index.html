<p>When designer and event planner Antony Todd designed the living room of his Greenwich Village apartment he conjured a soothing palette of whites and creams in the lampshades armchairs and center coffee tables. Large living space with a large L-shaped couch along with large white bookshelf lighted by a beautiful chandelier. Large white great room featuring a nice white living space with an L-shaped sofa a white dining table set and a white kitchen with a large center island with a breakfast bar. This is a fairly traditional living room touched up with white from the floor to the ceiling. Use other neutral colors to allow the stark white couches to be bold in the area.</p>
