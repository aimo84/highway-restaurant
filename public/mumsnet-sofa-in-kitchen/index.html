<p>A week at Bluestone with Mumsnet. Hi Were just about to knock through from dining room to kitchen and extend out. As we have dogs the kitchenfamily room is where we spend time until early evening my husband will sit while I am cooking we have a tv and stereo in there. Spray with scotch guard obviously. We do have a sofa bed well IKEA hemnes day bed in our kitchen dinner but its a large L shaped room with the kitchen in one section and sofa in completely different section.</p>

<p>I washed the covers. Asked Mumsnet users what made them middle class. I might go for black with a white throw and large white cushions. No having to very excitedly wait weeks on end for your new sofa to arrive and no sitting on a bean bag to watch your TV for a few months. Also the sofa was nice looking and comfortable.</p>
