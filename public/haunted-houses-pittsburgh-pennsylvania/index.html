<p>Allen’s haunted hayride &amp; tavern of terror. Once noted as “the most haunted house in america”, this home on pittsburgh’s north side is still creating chills, even though it is long gone. It still may be one of the most haunted places in pittsburgh. The whole estate of the claytons is intact, taking up 2 full blocks. The house at 3406 brownsville road has a long and storied history, especially if you believe the terrifying tales shared by perhaps its most famous resident, bob cranmer.</p>
