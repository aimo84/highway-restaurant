<p>Old galvanized gutters with seams have been replaced by seamless aluminum or copper gutters in a variety of brown, beige, gray, dark blue, red and green colors. Actual material can be used to match colors upon request. A gray house with black shutters, white trim and a black front door. As i need to install gutters, i was contemplating matching the gutter color to the metal roof. You want a gray siding that sits in the middle of the white and black.</p>

Grey is like a blank canvas that allows you to inject some personality into your home. Our first gray house example is a stunning 8,000 square foot lake michigan beachfront mansion. This would be in contrast to the rest of,the house which currently has white gutters, white azek trim and annapolis gray hardiplank siding (with a brown asphalt shingle roof), but i’m willing to change the existing white gutters to match if necessary.</p>
