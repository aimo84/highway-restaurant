<p>Long gone is the buffet and the lengthy list of americanized chinese food. The food is so good, the service attentive and friendly, and the interior and bathrooms are sparkling clean. I tried my usual favorite cantonese dishes: Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned. $$$$ price range per person up to $10.</p>
