<p>Glass house is a restaurant, bar, and modern day. Enjoy select wines by the bottle (or glass) in our relaxed garden patio. More than a building, this is a place to gather, nourish, experience, and to make progress. With views of the mountains and our vineyard right outside your door you are surrounded by peace and tranquility while you enjoy a hot breakfast to start your day, a salt water pool, hot tub. Over the last several years, glass house has become the headquarters for the industrious glass blowing factory (hennepin made), a minimalist cafe , a space for creative happenings, a retreat for artists, and an unlikely center for cultural exploration.</p>
