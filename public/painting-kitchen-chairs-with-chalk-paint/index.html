<p>Annie Sloan has started maki. Paint Brush I used a 2inch brush Wax Brush. This is how she painted them using Annie Sloan old white chalk paint. So I gave the chair a quick sand with medium grade sandpaper and a wipe down with sugar soap and water. Chalk painted kitchen cabinets have a vintage look and will work for shabby chic kitchen interiors for example.</p>
