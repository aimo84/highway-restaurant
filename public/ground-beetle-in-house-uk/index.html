<p>Ground beetles are common next to building foundations where they spend the day hidden in loose soil, or under stones, wood, leaves, or debris. Adult beetles become a nuisance when they are attracted to outside lights. Ground beetles in the subfamily ‘cicindelinae’ are known as ‘tiger beetles’. Species vary in size from 1.8mm (elaphropus parvulus) to 35mm (carabus intricatus) and exhibit a range of colouration. Ground beetles make up one of the largest groups of beetles in north america, with more than 2200 species.</p>

<p>All beetles have biting mouthparts. Because black ground beetles prefer residing outdoors they often do not become an indoor pest. Most are predatory or for the most part predatory and some are specialized in this role e.g. Although there is some variation in their body shape and coloring, most are shiny and black (some are metallic), and have ridged wing covers. Bristly body, dull metallic blue/green.</p>

<p>We see these beetles running across our carpets on most days. Anywhere that they could enter should be sealed up tightly. Ground beetles are usually black in colour and are a garden insect that can be found indoors during the summer and autumn months; Unlike most of the other species of carabidae, which are nocturnal, the tiger beetles are active diurnal hunters and are often brightly coloured. There are other insects like fleas that live in carpets, so hoovering is a good remedy all round.</p>
