<p>I think a full house is 3 of one type of card and 2 of another type. The odds of flopping a full house with a pocket pair is 0.98% or 1 in 102. So the probability of drawing a full house is 3744 2, 598, 960 = 6 4165 = 0.001441…. That would be 13 x 12 = 156. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out 49 cards). We know that the probability of getting a full house is given by:</p>
