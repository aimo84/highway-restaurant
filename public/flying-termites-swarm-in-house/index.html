<p>Rarely they will also swarm in the fall. Once a colony has reached capacity, the alates will boil out and go seeking mates. This typically occurs after a rain storm followed by sunny warm weather at this time of year. First of all, swarmers may be an indicator of an existing termite issue, depending upon where they came from. When ecological conditions are right, they will swarm in your house if a nest exists.</p>

<p>Think spraying will solve your problem. It really won’t help and may make things a deal worse later on. The termites shouldn’t be ignored though. These swarmers don’t fly very well and usually travel no more than about 100 meters from their original colony. Normally the swarm occurs quite suddenly on a wet early summer morning or on a warmish spring day.</p>

<p>A flying termite swarm near the home nest could indicate a large colony in the yard or some other nearby location. The flying termites don’t do any damage to your home or timber. Residents who find multiple alates inside, notice their shed wings around doors and windows, or see them emerging from the house exterior may. Grab a few termites and put them in a plastic bag or a jar in the freezer. When they appear indoors, it’s likely that worker termites are active somewhere within the home.</p>
