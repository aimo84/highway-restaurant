They need the moist soil as a haven to lay their eggs, and the organic matter in the soil feeds their larvae. Adult gnats will lay eggs in the soil, and the larvae (tiny white worms that are barely visible to the naked eye) will feed on roots and other organic matter in. Properly identifying the bugs flying around your indoor plants is the first step in getting rid of the annoying infestation.</p>

These little buggers are a really common pest over winter, and they're more attracted to the moist soil in houseplant pots than to the plants themselves. You will see them crawling around on top of the soil, or flying around your plants. These pests reproduce in the soil, and when the population gets large, the damage to your plants becomes noticeable.</p>
