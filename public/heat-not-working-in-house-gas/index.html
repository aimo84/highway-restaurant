<p>When you’ve got hot water but no heating, the first thing to do is check that the thermostat is working correctly. (some forced air systems run on electricity.) as the fuel is combusted, the heat produced in the burner passes through a heat exchanger. If it doesn’t, carefully use your water valve to adjust the pressure as needed. Without a generator, however, this is.
