<p>When it comes to painting your kitchen table and chairs choosing the best paint can be tricky. This gives you ultimate control over your kitchen colors. Kitchen chairs receive a lot of wear and tear prone to spills and being wiped often and so I recommend protecting the paint with a durable water-repellent top coat. It was a sturdy set just outdated. Tie them in a bow and hang it anywhereyou want something fun and festive.</p>
