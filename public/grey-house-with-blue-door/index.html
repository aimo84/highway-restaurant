<p>Dark grey exterior paint and white trim in a midcentury home design; Dark grey color and white trim combo on a brick house with siding combination; Interesting front door is on the side of the home due to the sloping nature of the lot. It features a white stoop roof right above it, which is supported by a pair of two square columns. The deeper the blue color, the more you reflect that feeling of stability for your home’s curb appeal.</p>

<p>Here’s another example of a home with a dark brown espresso stained front door only this time with muted light gray blue siding. Another beautiful blue/grey shingled exterior, this one in a darker shade. I would go with blue or yellow. It features a white stoop roof right above it, which is supported by a pair of two square columns. The color blue is often linked with thoughts and feelings of safety and security.</p>
