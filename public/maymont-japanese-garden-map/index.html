<p>In 1886, the dooleys first viewed and purchased the rough pasture and field that would become maymont. Guests may be photographed, and images may be used for commercial purposes. In 1911, a section of the kanawha canal was bought to be a part of the garden. Maymont’s japanese garden is a blend of several different styles of japanese gardens and two distinct periods of design. In 1925, the maymont estate was gifted to the government, turned into a public park and is now the most visited attraction in richmond.</p>
