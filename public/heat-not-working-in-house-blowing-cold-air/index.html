When your air vents are closed or blocked by furniture or drapes, the furnace can overheat like it does with a clogged air filter. However, not as many people have experienced a central heating system that doesn’t work.</p>

<p>When your air vents are closed or blocked by furniture or drapes, the furnace can overheat like it does with a clogged air filter. The thermostat is a principal regulator of how your heater works. Your furnace may be blowing cold air because the filter is too dirty. It can also be due to a clogged heater core, which will lead to low/no flow of coolant in the heater core. If the valve is malfunctioning, your heat pump will only work like an air conditioner—just cooling.</p>

<p>If your heating is not working, it's probably due to issues with the following: If you just turned on the heat, hot air may not yet be flowing through your air ducts. Regularly replace your air filter. Why is there no air coming from one vent in my house? Other vents that are on the other side of the house that are on the same heating zone do not experience this.</p>
