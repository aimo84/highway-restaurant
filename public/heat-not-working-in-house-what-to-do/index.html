<p>Other simple solutions to the problem of no heat in the house include finding the main power switch to the furnace. This is known as balancing the radiators. If you do not have heat, and you worked through the above, set the thermostat to aux or emergency. Sometimes this is all thatâs needed to reset your unit and get the heat flowing once again. Take any plastic covering off the new filter.</p>

<p>Take any plastic covering off the new filter. Obviously, your first action is to notify your landlord that the heating system in your 1 or 2 bedroom apartment isnât working and determine whether it is a major or minor repair problem. One of the simplest things to do is check your thermostat setting. Make sure your thermostat is set to heat mode. If there is no warmth at all on the radiator, youâll need to be sure that the thermostatic radiator valve and the lockshield valve on the other side are both open.</p>

<p>Just remove the faceplate of the thermostat by unscrewing the screws in the front and plug out. These often augment heat from heat pumps, which do not function as efficiently as it gets colder, and eventually do not work at all. They are the best people to advise you in this regards. By using the lockshield to control how much water can flow through each radiator, you can make sure that all of the radiators in your home heat up evenly. This may solve the problem of your heater not working.</p>
