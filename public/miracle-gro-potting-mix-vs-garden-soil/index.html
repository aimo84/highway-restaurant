<p>Potting soil may or may not contain soil , while potting mix is strictly a soilless medium. And the soil biology is greatly impaired. Apr 28, 2019 4:41 am cst. The difference between those fertilizers are synthetic vs organic. Potting soil, on the other hand, is soil that is often mixed with other ingredients that make the soil compatible for containers.</p>

<p>In some of the less expensive brands, there will be bark chips, as well, which adds bulk. Oddly enough i have used miracle grow potting mix (it isn't potting soil which is entirely unsuitable for containers) as well as the perfect gardener potting mix (from wally world). The synthetic fertilizers are faster than the organic. I never start my garden without adding miracle gro potting soil before anything is planted. Quality potting mixes are much less compactible than garden.</p>

<p>Garden soil is an amendment that is mixed with native soil, while potting soil is used alone for container gardens like potted houseplants and window boxes. On the other hand, potting soil is usually cheaper than potting mixes, and although the soil may be rich with nutrients, its density is a disadvantage and it makes it less ideal than potting mixes when it comes to container gardening. I never start my garden without adding miracle gro potting soil before anything is planted. Apr 28, 2019 4:41 am cst. I often use miracle grow mix as a baseline for the minimum acceptable potting mix for my containers.</p>

<p>The containers develop a perched water table causing excess water build up at the bottom. For example, they may contain peat, vermiculite (an expanded clay material), perlite, coconut coir, compost, or bark. And the soil biology is greatly impaired. Synthetic nutrients feed right away, and leave salts in the soil, where the organic nutrients have to be broken down slowly by the microbes in the soil. Ima post a journal of these results!</p>
