<p>Haunting anchorage’s young and old since 1985. One of anchorages oldest haunted house attractions. Continue to add the remaining flour, 1 cup at time, alternating with the water until a thick dough comes together. Build the house around the carton that way it can't break and collapse inward. I would live in a gingerbread house if i could, and i modeled this house on some of the adorable victorian houses in my town.</p>

<p>I'm a blogger, small business owner, wife, toddler mom, halloween fanatic, lover of all things gingerbread, sports fan, and craft beer drinker. Haunted mansion holiday will return for its 20th season this year! It’s easy to make houses haunted. Bake all the gingerbread for 12min, until dark. I found various haunted house kits, including this one from target for $8.99.</p>
