<p>Deer mice are more agile and better runners and jumpers than their house mouse counterparts. Deer mice have hairless tails, while house mice have hairy tails. Field mice (deer mice) have tan or brown fur on the top of their bodies, with white bellies, legs, and feet.

They prefer to live outdoors in fields, and will only really enter homes in the winter when it’s cold outside.</p>
