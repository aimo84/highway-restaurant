<p>If you use the above methods, the smell should dissipate quickly. 9 times out of 10 the culprit is probably something most of you had never thought of and it's something you shouldn't ignore! If you are used to preparing fish as a meal either by steaming it, frying it, etc, it’s not rocket science to know that fish smell extremely bad after you are done cooking it. Lopez recommends cooking the fish in a flavored liquid, such as court bouillon, which will help veil any fish odor. If you use the above methods, the smell should dissipate quickly.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about a lingering smell, try methods like poaching, steaming, and braising for cooking fish as they will produce fewer odors. Lopez recommends cooking the fish in a flavored liquid, such as court bouillon, which will help veil any fish odor. If you use the above methods, the smell should dissipate quickly. Apologies in advance if this is on the wrong board. Also not as fast a solution as simply overpowering the smell with cinnamon or a similar scent but the grounds left in a bowl can help absorb the odor and provide a more neutral solution than just covering the smell up.</p>

<p>The mystery fish odor in your home. I live in a relatively small condo, and even coming home. I'm trying to be all health conscious, which (for me) means eating more fish. If you are used to preparing fish as a meal either by steaming it, frying it, etc, it’s not rocket science to know that fish smell extremely bad after you are done cooking it.

<p>Lopez recommends cooking the fish in a flavored liquid, such as court bouillon, which will help veil any fish odor. But i'm really grossed out by the lingering smell after i've cooked the stuff. Frying, sauteing, and pan roasting produce more odors as they release more fat particles into the air. If you can’t resist sautéing your fish, remember that the lingering smell is from the oils spattering on your walls and other surfaces. A few weeks ago, we started to experience a strange fishy smell on our upstairs landing right outside of the bedrooms.</p>
