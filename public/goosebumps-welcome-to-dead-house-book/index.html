<p>Welcome to dead house is the one that started it all, and it is a classic, in this reviewer's opinion. Welcome to dead house was the first book in the original goosebumps book series. They have moved into their new neighborhood and start noticing some weird things going on, as well as how dead everyone looks. A turn of events that the reader doesn't see coming. Go out and make some new friends.</p>
