<p>“ if i worked within walking distance of nancy’s sky garden, i would probably have financed at least once of nancy’s children’s college educations by now. My personal favorite items on the menu are the prism roll with the almond ginger chicken salad with a side of peanut soy and the signature plate with grilled chicken and sweet potato noodles. A lot of people think that you can have great ice tea, lemonade or coffee at this place. Get in the building and take the elevator to the fourth floor.
